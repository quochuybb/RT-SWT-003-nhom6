You can add multiple request bodies to your *path operation function*, even though a request can only have a single body.

But **FastAPI** will handle it, give you the correct data in your function, and validate and document the correct schema in the *path operation*.

You can also declare singular values to be received as part of the body.

And you can instruct **FastAPI** to embed the body in a key even when there is only a single parameter declared.
