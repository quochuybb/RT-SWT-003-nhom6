## 0.24.0 (2019-05-24)

* Add support for WebSockets with dependencies and parameters.
    * Support included for:
        * `Depends`
        * `Security`
        * `Cookie`
        * `Header`
        * `Path`
        * `Query`
        * ...as these are compatible with the WebSockets protocol (e.g. `Body` is not).
    * [Updated documentation for WebSockets](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/).
