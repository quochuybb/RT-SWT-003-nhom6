# Server Workers - Uvicorn with Workers { #server-workers-uvicorn-with-workers }

Let's check back those deployment concepts from before:

* Security - HTTPS
* Running on startup
* Restarts
* **Replication (the number of processes running)**
* Memory
* Previous steps before starting

Up to this point, with all the tutorials in the docs, you have probably been running a **server program**, for example, using the `fastapi` command, that runs Uvicorn, running a **single process**.

When deploying applications you will probably want to have some **replication of processes** to take advantage of **multiple cores** and to be able to handle more requests.

As you saw in the previous chapter about [Deployment Concepts](concepts.md), there are multiple strategies you can use.

Here I'll show you how to use **Uvicorn** with **worker processes** using the `fastapi` command or the `uvicorn` command directly.

/// note

If you are using containers, for example with Docker or Kubernetes, I'll tell you more about that in the next chapter: [FastAPI in Containers - Docker](docker.md).

In particular, when running on **Kubernetes** you will probably **not** want to use workers and instead run **a single Uvicorn process per container**, but I'll tell you about it later in that chapter.

## Multiple Workers { #multiple-workers }

You can start multiple workers with the `--workers` command line option:

//// tab | `fastapi`

If you use the `fastapi` command:

```console
$ fastapi run --workers 4 main.py

      INFO   Application startup complete.
      INFO   Application startup complete.
```

////

//// tab | `uvicorn`

If you prefer to use the `uvicorn` command directly:

```console
$ uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --workers 4
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started parent process [27365]
INFO:     Started server process [27368]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Started server process [27369]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Started server process [27370]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Started server process [27367]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

////

The only new option here is `--workers` telling Uvicorn to start 4 worker processes.

You can also see that it shows the **PID** of each process, `27365` for the parent process (this is the **process manager**) and one for each worker process: `27368`, `27369`, `27370`, and `27367`.

## Deployment Concepts { #deployment-concepts }

Here you saw how to use multiple **workers** to **parallelize** the execution of the application, take advantage of **multiple cores** in the CPU, and be able to serve **more requests**.

From the list of deployment concepts from above, using workers would mainly help with the **replication** part, and a little bit with the **restarts**, but you still need to take care of the others:

* **Security - HTTPS**
* **Running on startup**
* ***Restarts***
* Replication (the number of processes running)
* **Memory**
* **Previous steps before starting**

## Containers and Docker { #containers-and-docker }

In the next chapter about [FastAPI in Containers - Docker](docker.md) I'll explain some strategies you could use to handle the other **deployment concepts**.

I'll show you how to **build your own image from scratch** to run a single Uvicorn process. It is a simple process and is probably what you would want to do when using a distributed container management system like **Kubernetes**.

## Recap { #recap }

You can use multiple worker processes with the `--workers` CLI option with the `fastapi` or `uvicorn` commands to take advantage of **multi-core CPUs**, to run **multiple processes in parallel**.

You could use these tools and ideas if you are setting up **your own deployment system** while taking care of the other deployment concepts yourself.

Check out the next chapter to learn about **FastAPI** with containers (e.g. Docker and Kubernetes). You will see that those tools have simple ways to solve the other **deployment concepts** as well. ✨
